# Space Manager 1.0.0
Manager for creating and managing space switches[^1]for rigs with and without mGear.  
User builds a rig, launches the GUI, configures needed settings and either runs the process straight from the GUI or exports configurations as smd file and creates a build based on the file later programmatically.
