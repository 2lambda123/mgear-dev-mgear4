.. note::

	from Miquel:
		Big thanks to `Jeremie Passerin <http://www.jeremiepasserin.com/blog/>`_ , he is the real master behind mGear design. I am just following  his steps and continuing what he started.

		Also special big thanks to `Ingo Clemens <http://www.braverabbit.de/>`_ for the OSX solver compilation and `Gaetan Guidet <https://github.com/gatgui>`_ for the Linux solver compilation and guidance in my C++ desert of knowledge.

		Thanks to `Chad Vernon <http://www.chadvernon.com/blog/>`_ , for his fantastic tutorials and open-source tools. Some of mGear's parts wouldn't be possible without it.

		And thanks!! to all the people who help me and support this project :)
