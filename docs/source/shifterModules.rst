Introduction
------------

Shifter is the default autorigging modular system included with mGear. This system is provided with the hope to solve the majority of your rigging necesities. From a freelancer or small boutique to a big studio.

Shifter can be use in a wide variety of projects. Animated feature films, video games, VR, VFX, TV series, etc... and can build rigs for any kind of asset. i.e: cartoon characters, creatures, robots, props, vehicles, etc...

Shifter have been build on top of mGear framework and can co-exist with other rigging systems inside mGear framework. In other words, if Shifter's paradigm doesn't fit your rigging needs, you can create another rigging system using the same mGear base modules.
